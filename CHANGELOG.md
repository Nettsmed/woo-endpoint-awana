## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Sync status tracking via repurposed `crm_sync_woo` meta field
- Automatic CRM sync when order status changes to "completed"
- Admin UI dashboard for managing syncs (`WooCommerce → Awana Sync`)
- Manual sync functionality by order ID
- Failed syncs list with retry functionality
- Additional sync tracking meta fields (`_awana_sync_last_attempt`, `_awana_sync_last_success`, `_awana_sync_last_error`, `_awana_sync_error_count`)

### Changed
- Status mapping updated: `pog_status="order"` → `status="transferred"` (was `"pending"`)
- Status mapping now prioritizes WooCommerce order status over POG status
- `crm_sync_woo` now tracks sync status (`success`/`failed`/`pending`/`never_synced`) instead of static `synced` value

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed
- Minor bug fixes and improvements

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Outbound webhook for invoice status/KID/invoice number sync (`invoiceStatusWebhook`)
- Support for syncing `pog_status`, `pog_kid_number`, and `pog_invoice_number` meta fields
- Per-field deduplication markers (`_pog_*_synced_to_crm`) to prevent duplicate webhook sends
- Status mapping: `pog_status=order` → `status=pending`, `pog_status=invoice` → `status=unpaid`
- New configuration constants:
  - `AWANA_INVOICE_STATUS_WEBHOOK_URL` (required)
  - `AWANA_INVOICE_STATUS_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` (optional)

### Changed
- Split POG sync into two separate webhooks:
  - `invoiceCustomerNumberWebhook`: only sends `pog_customer_number` changes
  - `invoiceStatusWebhook`: sends `pog_status`, `pog_kid_number`, `pog_invoice_number` changes
- Updated `notify_pog_customer_number_to_crm()` payload (removed `memberId` field)
- Refactored webhook sending to use shared `send_x_api_key_webhook()` method

### Fixed
- Prevent duplicate webhook sends when both `updated_postmeta` and HPOS save hooks fire
- Improved deduplication logic to track last synced value per field
